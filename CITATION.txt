Source code
-----------

You can refer to individual versions of Tesseroids through their DOIs.
However, please **also cite the Geophysics paper**.

For example. if you want to mention that you used the 1.1.1 version,
you can go to :ref:`the Releases page <releases>` of the documentation
and get the DOI link for that version.
This link will not be broken, even if I move the site somewhere else.

You can also cite the specific version instead of just providing the link.
If you click of the DOI link for 1.1.1, the Zenodo page will
recommend that you cite it as:

    Uieda, Leonardo. (2015). Tesseroids v1.1.1: Forward modeling of
    gravitational fields in spherical coordinates. Zenodo. 10.5281/zenodo.15800


Conference proceeding
---------------------

The previous way citation for Tesseroids was a conference proceeding from the
2011 GOCE User Workshop:

    Uieda, L., E. P. Bomfim, C. Braitenberg, and E. Molina (2011),
    Optimal forward calculation method of the Marussi tensor
    due to a geologic structure at GOCE height,
    Proceedings of the 4th International GOCE User Workshop.
